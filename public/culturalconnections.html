        <h3>Top two cultural shocks I experienced when moving to Vancouver, Canada</h3>
        <p>One of them is that here all the people feel secure on every place, they just walk with their phones and expesive items that all people can see, and that is too dangerous in my country (Ecuador).
            Also I really was chocked about all the cultures that I can find here, just in one month I made new friends from several nationalities!
        </p>

        <h3>Top two things I miss most from my home country</h3>
        <p>I really miss the food, in Ecuador we have a really nice gastronomy with delicious food to eat and really tasty for all the people, also with a lot of diversity, you can eat different food in Costa and Sierra.
            The second one is my family, I miss them but I really appreciate their efforts that bring me here and I will do as much I can for them be proud.
